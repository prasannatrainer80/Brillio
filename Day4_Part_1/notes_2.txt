The Is-A Relationship:
The is-a relationship, also known as the inheritance relationship, represents a type of relationship between two classes where one class is a specialized version of another. It implies that a subclass is a specific type of its superclass. For example, consider a class hierarchy with a superclass called "Animal" and a subclass called "Dog." We can say that a Dog is an Animal, which reflects the is-a relationship.

Code Reusability: Inheritance allows subclasses to inherit the properties and behaviors of the superclass. This promotes code reuse, as the subclass can leverage the existing code of the superclass without having to rewrite it.
Polymorphism: Polymorphism, a key feature of object-oriented programming, is closely related to the is-a relationship. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables more flexibility and extensibility in the design and implementation of software.
Method Overriding: Subclasses can override methods inherited from the superclass to provide their own implementation. This allows for customization and specialization of behavior according to the specific needs of the subclass while still maintaining the is-a relationship.

Has-A Relationship in Java

In Java, a Has-A relationship is a form of association where one class contains a reference to another class. This relationship is also known as composition or aggregation. It is used to achieve code reusability and to establish a connection between two classes.

Key Concepts

Association: This is a general term that describes a relationship between two classes. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.

Composition: This is a strong form of association where the contained object cannot exist independently of the container object. For example, a car has an engine, and the engine cannot exist without the car.

Aggregation: This is a weaker form of association where the contained object can exist independently of the container object. For example, an employee has an address, but the address can exist without the employee
