Looping Control Structures : 

1) While loop : This loop executes all the statement(s) repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. 

For every loop, basically there are 3 phases known as 

	(i) Initialization

	(ii) Condition

	(iii) Increment/Decrement 


Initialization performed at the beginning of the loop

Condition performed at the conditional part of the loop

Increment/Decrement performed before closing the loop

while(condition) {
   statement(s);
}

for loop : Executes the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. 

for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement) {
   statement(s);
}

Arrays : An array is the finite ordered set of homogeneous elements, means all the elements belongs to same data type. 

All the elements of array are stored in successive memory locations. 

You can declare an array as

datatype[] variable = new datatype[size];

int[] a = new int[5]{10,22,53,19,21};

a[0]=10;
a[1]=22;
a[2]=53;
a[3]=19;
a[4]=21;

int[] a = new int[]{10,22,53,19,21};
//		for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++) {
//			System.out.println(a[i]);
//		}
		for (int i : a) {
			System.out.println(i);
		}

How interally foreach loop is working ???

In foreach loop, at first i points to the first element in array A, after processing first element it checks the next element is there or not by using hasMoreElements(), if hasMoreElements() returns true, it moves to next element by using nextElement(). It repeats as soon as hasMoreElements() returns true. 

There are 2 types of memories as

(i) Stack

(ii) Heap

*** Value types will be stored in STACK memory, and reference types will be stored in Heap Memory ***

s2="Srihari"

1) Write a Program to check the email is valid or not (if @ found print valid else print Invalid)

2) Write a Program to remove all vowels from the given string and store in different string

3) Write a Program to take array of string names and show which names are duplicated 

example 

String[] names = {"Dinesh","Anoop","Mounika","Anoop","Natraj","Manish","Anoop","Manish"};

4) Write a Program to Print all palindrome words in your given strig. 

String str="Shwetha MadaM is helping in workplace...Malayalam is language in Kerala...";

public int check(int n) {
   if (n%2==0) {
     return 1;
   } else {
     return 2;
   }
}

public int check(int n) {
   if (n%2==0) {
     return 1;
   } 
     return 2;
}

int a;

a="Hello";
a=12;
a=12.5

Object a;
a="Hello";
a=12;
a=12.5

Boxing and Unboxing : The concept of converting value type to reference type known as boxing, and reference type to value type known as unboxing. 

Object is the type that which can be used for boxing and unboxing. 

For boxing and unboxing, we need to use primitive data type classes 

int  -> Integer
float -> Float
double -> Double
boolean -> Boolean
