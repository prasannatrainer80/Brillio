A constructor is a special member, that which used to initialize the member variables of the class, it is special because it has the same name as that of class name. 

Rules : 
________

	(i) It will not contains any return type

	(ii) It will not return any value

	(iii) It will be invoked automatically once the instance of the class created

	 (iv) A constructor can be overloaded 


There are 2 types of constructors known as 

	(i) static constructor : These are called class constructors, these constructors are invoked automatically before control reaches the entry point. You cannot overload the static constructor. static constructors are used to initialize the static variables. 

*** In java we dont have any static constructors, as static {} acts as static constructor ***

	(ii) instance constructor : These are the constructors that which are invoked automatically once the instance of the class created. These constructors can be overloaded. 

this keyword : Used to identifiy the member variables of the class. 

class Test {
   int a;
   Test(int a) {
	this.a=a;
   }
}
